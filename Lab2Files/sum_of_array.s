# Students: 
# Tanner Shartel (50% effort)
# Katie Dionne  (50% effort)
# Insert your answers below each question:-
# 1(a) What is the address location of the first element of the array, X.
#
# The first address location is 10010004
#
# 1(b) What is the address location of the last element (element 7) of the array, X.
#
# The last address location is 1001000c
#
# 2.   What are the values at location 'SUM' as the program executes?
#
# SUM is initialized to 0 in the .data, and results in 1 after the program completes.
#
# 3.   Traverse the program in single-step mode. Write down the intermediate 
#      values stored in register $s1 as the program progresses.
#
# fffffffe, fffffffa, 1
#
# 4.   What is the purpose of register $t0 in this program?
#
# Register $t0 holds the addresses for the elements in the array. Initially, it is set to the first element, 
# and loops through each element until all elements have been summed.
#
.data                       # Put Global Data here
N:      .word 3         # 'N' is the address which contains the loop count, 5
X:      .word -2, -4, 7     # 'X' is the address of the 1st element in the array to be added
SUM:    .word 0         # 'SUM' is the address that stores the final sum
